        arch	isize	usize

        Note: isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer
        your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as ‚Äúarch‚Äù: 64
        bits if you‚Äôre on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you‚Äôre on a 
        32-bit architecture.
        
        Note: The primary situation in which you‚Äôd use isize or usize is when 
        indexing some sort of collection.

        Number literal	Example
        -----------------------------
        Decimal	        98_222
        Hex	            0xff

        Binary	        0b1111_0000
        Byte (u8 only)   b'A'

        Handling overflow
            * Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add
            * Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods
            * Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow
                with the overflowing_* methods
            * Saturate at the value‚Äôs minimum or maximum values with saturating_*
                methods
